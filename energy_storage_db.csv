The project is based at SCE’s Monolith Substation in Tehachapi, California and includes a 32 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) and the associated power conversion system. The project will evaluate the performance of the BESS to improve grid performance and assist in the integration of large-scale variable energy resourced generation. Project performance will be measured with 13 specific operational uses: 

1. Provide voltage support and grid stabilization 2. Decrease transmission losses 3. Diminish congestion 4.  Increase system reliability  5. Defer transmission investment 6. Optimize size of new renewable-related transmission 7. Provide system capacity and resource adequacy 8. Integrate renewable energy (smoothing) 9. Shift wind generation output 10. Frequency regulation 11. Spin / non-spin replacement reserves 12. Ramp management 13. Energy price arbitrage. 

Most of the operations either shift other generation resources to meet peak load and other electricity system needs with stored electricity, or resolve grid stability and capacity concerns that result from the interconnection of variable energy resources.

In the event of a generation or transmission related outage, it can provide 27 megawatts of power for 15 minutes. That's enough time for the co-op to start up local generation when there are problems with the Intertie or power plants in Anchorage.

One of the requirements for construction of the Intertie was a reactive power supply capable of delivering power should generation fail. At the heart of the world's most powerful energy storage battery are two core components: the Nickel-Cadmium (Ni-Cad) batteries, developed by Saft, and the converter, designed and supplied by ABB. The converter changes the batteries' DC power into AC power ready for use in GVEA's transmission system.

Awards Received:

- ABB was awarded the Platts 2003 Global Energy Award for their design and development of the BESS converter.
- The Electric Power Resarch Institue Technology Award for the BESS project at the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association Annual Meeting on February 15 2004.
- Guiness World Record certificate acknowledging that the BESS is the world's most powerful battery on December 10, 2003. During a test of its maximum limit, it discharged 46 megawatts for five minutes

Statistics:

- 13,760 liquid electrolyte-filled Ni-Cad cells

Beginning operation in 1997, the MP&L BESS has a 1 MW peak power output, and 1.4 MWh energy capacity. It is capable of supporting continuous loads of 800 kilovolt amperes (kVA), pulse loads up to 1200 kVA, and consists of 378 Absolyte VRLA 100A75 modules. Nearly 5 MW of hydroelectric generation capacity provides almost all of MP&L’s power, with a 3.3 MW diesel generation system relegated to reserve duty. MP&L’s two hydroelectric plants, Purple Lake and Chester Lake, have reservoir storage capacity, though the hydro generators were too slow to respond to sudden load fluctuations. At the time of the BESS’s initial operations, the MP&L peak load was approximately 4 MW. A lumber mill in Metlakatla (since closed down) caused large, sudden power spikes on the community’s islanded power system, and the BESS was installed to provide fast response for the mill’s rapid load changes.

The MP&L BESS is housed in a purpose-built 40-foot by 70-foot steel butler building that sits on a cement pad. Installation cost of the 1 MW / 1.4 MWh Exide Metlakatla BESS was $1.6 million in 1996 dollars (estimated cost in 2009 dollars: $2.2 million). The battery system became operational in February 1997. It operated continuously for 11.5 years until September 2008, when the battery was replaced with a new VRLA product. The VRLA battery exceeded its 8-year design life by over 3 years. The BESS is estimated to have saved MP&L over $6.5 million over its life in reduced fuel consumption and maintenance, in addition to reduced greenhouse emissions. A new battery was installed with the support of the Alaska Commerce, Community, and Economic Development Agency, so the BESS will continue to provide benefits to the community for many years to come.

During discharge, 340 pounds of air flow out of the cavern each second. The cavern can discharge for 26 hours. The plant also utilizes nuclear-sourced night-time power for compression and then produces peak power during the day by releasing the compressed air into a 110-MW gas-fired combustion turbine built by Dresser Rand. The turbine unit also makes use of an air-to-air heat exchanger to preheat air from the cavern with waste heat from the turbine. The waste heat recovery system reduces fuel usage by roughly 25%.

Keys III Pump-Generating Plant (formerly known as Grand Coulee Pump-Generating Plant) pumps water uphill 280 feet from Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake to Banks Lake. This water is used to irrigate approximately 670,000 acres of farmland in the Columbia Basin Project. More than 60 crops are grown in the basin and distributed across the nation

Construction of the irrigation facilities began in 1948. Components of the project include the pump-generating plant, feeder canal, and equalizing reservoir, which was later named Banks Lake. Banks Lake was formed by damming the northern 27 miles of the Grand Coulee, and has an active storage capacity of 715,000 acre-feet. The lake stores water for irrigation and also provides important recreational benefits to the region. The pump-generating plant began operation in 1951. From 1951 to 1953, six pumping units, each rated at 65,000 horsepower and with a capacity to pump 1,600 cubic feet per second, were installed in the plant. 

In the early 1960s, investigations revealed the potential for power generation. Reversible pumps were installed to allow water from Banks Lake to flow back through the units to generate power during periods of peak demand. The first three generating pumps came online in 1973. Two more generating pumps were installed in 1983; the final generating pump was installed in January 1984. The total generating capacity of the plant is now 314,000 kilowatts. In 2008, the pump-generating plant was renamed in honor of John W. Keys III. Keys was Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation from 2001 to 2006 and Pacific Northwest Regional Director from 1986 to 1998.

The pumping function at Castaic hydroelectric plant provides additional water for power generation beyond the supply of water available from the flow of the State Aqueduct.

When energy demand is high, water is released from the upper reservoir to the plant where electricity is generated before the water is discharged into the lower reservoir. When demand is low at times such as night, water is then pumped back up to the upper reservoir to be used as stored energy for a later time. This is accomplished by pump-generators which serve a dual role as both pumps which can reverse into generators. The plant can go from a stand still to operational in eight minutes which allows it to meet peak energy demand. It consumes more electricity pumping versus generating electricity but pumping occurs during periods of low demand, making the plant economical.

This pumping mode is normally utilized during early morning hours when power demands are low. The pump-back storage principle is advantageous because the generating units can be started quickly and adjustments made rapidly to respond to varying daily and seasonal power demands.

In between the two plants is a forebay capable of holding about 740 million gallons of water; behind the Lewiston plant, a 1,900-acre, 22 billion gallon reservoir holds additional supplies of this liquid fuel.

Water is diverted from the Niagara River—up to 375,000 gallons a second—and conveyed through conduits under the City of Niagara Falls to Lewiston. From there, water flowing through the Robert Moses plant spins turbines that power generators, converting this mechanical energy into electrical energy.

At night, when electricity demand is low, the Lewiston units operate as pumps, transporting water from the forebay up to the plant's reservoir.

During the daytime, when electricity use peaks, the Lewiston pumps are reversed and become generators, similar to those at the Moses plant. In this way, the water can be used to produce electricity twice, increasing production and efficiency.

To balance the need for power with a desire to preserve the beauty of Niagara Falls, the United States and Canada signed a treaty in 1950 that regulates the amount of water diverted for hydroelectricity production. On average, more than 200,000 cubic feet per second (cfs), or 1.5 million gallons of water a second, flow from Lake Erie into the Niagara River. The 1950 pact requires that at least 100,000 cfs of water spill over the Falls during the daylight hours in the tourist season, April through October. This flow may be cut in half at night during this period and at all times the rest of the year.

The plant was built between 1969-73 and is jointly owned by Consumers Energy and Detroit Edison, and operated by Consumers Energy.
The plant contributes directly to local governments about $11 million in annual property taxes.  Revenue from plant operations, maintenance and overhauls also contribute significant sums to the local economy.  Local residents still refer to the plant as “The Project”.

One of the world’s biggest electric “batteries”, Ludington can provide energy at a moment’s notice. Its ability lies in its 27-billion gallon reservoir and a set of six turbines that drive electric generators.  Those same turbines double as giant water pumps to fill the reservoir with water from Lake Michigan.
At night, when electric demand is low, Ludington’s reversible turbines pump water 363 feet uphill from Lake Michigan. The water is pumped through six large pipes, or “penstocks”, to the 842-acre reservoir. During the day, when electric demand is high, the reservoir releases water to flow downhill through the penstocks. The flowing water turns turbines and generators in the powerhouse to make electricity.
The plant can generate up to 1,872 megawatts — enough electricity to serve a community of 1.4 million residential customers. The output is more than double the capacity of any single unit on Consumers Energy’s system.
Ludington’s relatively simple technology enables the plant to respond quickly to the daily, weekly and seasonal highs and lows of Michigan’s energy demand. The plant also saves customers money by enabling Consumers Energy to avoid the expensive spot market when customer demand exceeds the capacity of the company’s baseload plants.  The immense size of Ludington and its six-unit design offers flexibility in balancing customer demand with electric output on a moment’s notice. 

Consumers Energy and Detroit Edison announced an $800 million upgrade on February 7 2011.

The four-unit station began generating electricity in 1991, and is the largest hydroelectric station on the Duke Energy system. It is named for the two streams, Bad Creek and West Bad Creek, which were dammed to create the Bad Creek reservoir.

The Bad Creek facility utilizes two reservoirs (or lakes) to generate electricity: an upper reservoir and a lower reservoir. Water stored in an upper lake is released into underground power tunnels. The water rushes down the tunnels, driving huge turbines, which are underground at the base of a dam. The spinning turbines are connected to large generators, which produce the electricity. The water then flows through draft tubes into a lower lake.

A pumped-storage hydroelectric station uses the same water over and over again, making more efficient use of water resources. When demand for electricity is low, operators can refill the lake, as if they were “recharging” a battery. Using power from other generating stations, the generators act as electric motors spinning the huge turbines backward. This pumps water back up the power tunnels into the upper lake. Water is generally pumped back to the upper reservoir at night and on weekends.

With the reservoir at full-pond elevation and generating with all four units, Bad Creek can generate for 24 hours within its maximum 160’ drawdown.

New Waddell Dam's primary purpose is to store Colorado River water for CAP use. The dam also stores Agua Fria River runoff and provides flood protection by controlling river flows. The dam is located one-half mile downstream of historic Waddell Dam, which was built by the Maricopa Water District (MWD). The dam's reservoir, Lake Pleasant, also stores water for MWD irrigation.

In the winter, Colorado River water is pumped uphill from the CAP aqueduct into Lake Pleasant when power rates are low. In the summer, when demand for water and electricity increases, water is released through the Pump-Generating plant, producing hydroelectric power that is sold to help repay the CAP's construction costs. In addition, New Waddell Dam adds 7,000 surface acres to the lake, greatly increasing the recreational value of Lake Pleasant Regional Park.

Handicapped-accessible recreational facilities include 3 multiple-lane boat ramps, 450 picnic sites, 225 campsites, 14 group use areas, 4 overlooks, a full-service marina equipped to handle 1000 boats, and 7 miles of trail. Because the reservoir water level may fluctuate up to 125 feet during a typical year's operation, the facilities will be located to be accessible during both high and low water periods.

If necessary, floodwaters can be released from the dam through the river outlet works tunnel into the Agua Fria River immediately below the dam.

Nestled beneath 2,000-foot-tall Brown Mountain, this project generates more than one million kilowatts of electricity in peak demand periods by drawing water from Schoharie Creek and recycling it between two huge reservoirs.

Blenheim-Gilboa serves two vital functions. It saves money for New York consumers by providing low-cost electricity when they need it most. And it stores water for emergency power production. If necessary, this project can be up and running within two minutes. It can ""pinch hit"" if another plant or line suddenly goes out of service.

A $135-million four-year program to modernize and extend the life of the Blenheim-Gilboa project was completed in May 2010. As part of the four-year program, known as LEM (Life Extension and Modernization), one of project’s four turbine-generator units was taken out of service each fall for approximately eight months. Most of the unit’s mechanical and electrical components were replaced, with repairs made to virtually all other parts.

Ultimately, the NaS units offer AEP a degree of flexibility in determining the optimal approach for handling reliability problems. The units buy the utility time to decide whether to redesign a substation, build generation, or keep the storage units in place permanently. (All of the NaS systems are capable of being relocated for an estimated $85,000 to $115,000 if and when the company’s needs for storage change.)

AEP’s 2-MW units were deployed in 2008, and are capable of providing islanding (backup power) for over seven hours when loss of utility power from the substation occurs. These newer installations can also perform load-triggered load leveling which, for example, allows the batteries to discharge just enough energy to hold a constrained substation transformer constant. As a result, a greater amount of energy can be reserved for islanding and battery life can be extended due to less frequent discharging.

AEP uses an in-house SCADA system and developed custom software to control all of its batteries based on the loading transformer. The software essentially creates a feedback loop where the load of the transformer is compared to a desired maximum, and the battery output is then adjusted to achieve that maximum.

In addition, the unit sited at the Balls Gap substation in Milton, WV successfully islanded approximately 700 customers for roughly 30 minutes during a simulated outage staged on July 8, 2009. A live islanding event, meanwhile, took place in December 2009, during a snowstorm that islanded 25 customers for two days. Over that period, the Milton installation was able to minimize disruptions; customers experienced less than three minutes of continuous disruption during the two-day outage period.

Finally, on October 20, 2009, the Milton, WV battery was successfully operated to alleviate load and voltage concerns during a load transfer event between substations. While the transformer at one station was taken out of service for maintenance, load was transferred to a different station which caused voltage and loading concerns. The Milton battery was deployed and mitigated these concerns.

The molten salt “receiver” is actually comprised of panels formed by hundreds of special alloy tubes which will be flowing with molten salt for energy absorption and storage. Once complete, the project will be capable of storing 10 hours of full load electricity production, enough to power 75,000 homes at peak electric demand periods, even after dark.

Unlike water, molten salt remains in a liquid state at high temperatures, enabling it to be transported to ground level and stored through a relatively inexpensive system of pipes and tanks. On an as-needed basis, the heated salt is used to boil water to operate a steam-driven turbine, a part of the process that is exactly like any conventional fossil fuel power plant.

The demonstration area includes 150 square miles including parts of Columbus, Bexley, Gahanna, New Albany, Whitehall, Reynoldsburg, Westerville, Blacklick, Johnstown, Alexandria, Minerva Park, and Pataskala. This area includes approximately 110,000 meters and 70 distribution circuits. AEP Ohio will implement Smart Grid technology over 58 13kV circuits from 10 distribution stations and 12 34.5kV circuits from six distribution stations. Included in this project is a redistribution management system, integrated volt-VAR control, distribution automation, advanced meter infrastructure, home area networks, community energy storage, sodium sulfur battery storage, and renewable generation sources. These technologies will be combined with two-way consumer communication and information sharing, demand response, dynamic pricing, and consumer products, such as plug-in hybrid vehicles.

The plan was to integrate 80 CES (25kW/25kWh) units of storage resources into the existing grid. After initial testing, AEP Ohio began field installations and commissioned 15 CES units into operations by December 31, 2011. Following this deployment, technical issues were discovered and the CES units were not performing to AEP Ohio’s stringent standards. The CES units were removed from the field and returned to S&C. This component of the project has been redefined to include a limited deployment of four CES units at an outdoor test environment on AEP Ohio property to continue extensive testing.

This could be the largest deployment of Ice Bears and provides participants an ability to achieve Utility-scale peak demand reduction and shifting of air conditioner load, while also providing valued efficiency improvements for individual commercial and industrial (C/I) customers - without sacrificing customer comfort.  To date, 7 members and 2 other POUs have installed approximately 2.5MW of TES capacity in more than 200 customer's facilities.  

These installations have provided participants new opportunities to work with C/I customers in partnership to help them cost-effectively reduce peak demand and shift energy usage to the off-peak period.  In addition, the SCPPA agreement with Ice Energy requires that local engineers and HVAC contractors be used for the design and installation processes and that supplies and materials be acquired locally, to the greatest extent possible to provide local and regional economic development opportunities in the communities served by the participants.

In essence, participants are purchasing and installing the Ice Bears and related equipment with little or no monetary contribution from the customers.  This business model is considered to be optimal, particularly for initial deployment, because utilities are the recipients of the most value or benefits from the PLS technology.  That is, while customers may see reduced on-peak usage, unless they are on TOU rates, there may not be much (if any) reduction in their bill and energy savings from the TES.  However there are significant operational, economic, and environmental benefits inherent with peak load shifting that are achieved by electric utilities who implement energy storage programs including, but not limited to: avoidance on-peak generation, operation and/or construction; improved load factor and ""flattening"" of load curves; reducing minimum load conditions and assimilation of intermittent renewable resources that also might be delivered off-peak; and reducing or removing constraints on overloaded distribution circuits or feeders to help defer or avoid capital intensive system improvements.

One of the charging stations is used exclusively by car sharing firm I-GO, while the other is available to the public. Alternative Transportation for Chicagoland owns the installation, and other project partners included architects Farr Associates and Continental Electric Construction Company.

""As more and more electric vehicles are sold each year, the strains on the electrical grid will continue to increase,"" said AllCell CEO Said Al-Hallaj.

The combination of on-site generation and on-site storage co-located with EV charging stations will be a critical part of ensuring that continued growth in the EV market doesn't disrupt the normal operation of the electrical grid.

According to WindFree President Doug Snower, ""The combination of advanced battery technology incorporated with our solar canopy EV charging stations make this a dream project for Windfree. We look forward to sharing open source data through a web base monitoring portal that will demonstrate utility infrastructure benefits and energy savings.""

The projected CO2 emissions avoided is equivalent to taking approximately 20,000 cars off the road annually. The project required an investment of $266 million USD, and the project officially went to operation in June 2007. Electricity production is estimated to be 134 million kilowatt hours per year.

It is the second solar thermal power plant built in the United States in more than 16 years, and the largest STE plant built in the world since 1991. It is located in Eldorado Valley in the southwest fringe of Boulder City, Nevada, and was built in that city's Energy Resource Zone, which requires renewable generation as part of plant development permits; Nevada Solar One was approved as part of Duke Energy's larger El Dorado Energy project that built 1 GW of electrical generation capacity. The solar trough generation was built by Acciona Solar Power, a partially owned subsidiary of Spanish conglomerate Acciona Energy. Lauren Engineers & Constructors (Abilene, TX) was the EPC contractor for the project.Acciona purchased a 55 percent stake in Solargenix (formerly Duke Solar) and Acciona owns 95 percent of the project. Nevada Solar One is unrelated to the Solar One power plant in California.

The innovation started in the tidy development of Stones Throw in East Stroudsburg, where developers had installed identical ETS units in the 1980′s and ’90s, making it a perfect place to pilot VCharge’s technology. Now, over 40 Stones Throw homeowners, and nearly another 100 in the surrounding area, have installed free controls on their ETS heaters to participate in this radical experiment in grid storage and energy management–and to get a 25% discount on their home heating bills.

By itself, any individual heating system is relatively unremarkable. But together, the 134 homes in VCharge’s Aggregated Transactive Load Asset (ATLAS) create a huge resource for grid balancing–specifically providing ancillary services like fast frequency response through the markets run by PJM. This reservoir of capacity, both to cut load on the system (effectively generating negawatts) and to absorb rapid influxes of energy (for example from a sudden surge from a solar or wind farm) means that grid operators have a powerful new tool in their belts to deal with the coming demands of a shifting energy mix.",http://vcharge-energy.com/blog/2013/03/20/worlds-largest-battery/,,,DD.10.YYYY,,PJM,PPL,,,,Third-Party-Owned,"VCharge, Inc.",,,,"VCharge, Inc.","VCharge, Inc.","VCharge, Inc.","VCharge, Inc.","VCharge, Inc.",,,,,30,"10 MWh; $75/kW, $15/kWh",154000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,George Baker,gbaker@vcharge-energy.com,(866) 607-0402,"235 Promenade St, Suite 475",Providence,RI,02908,United States,DD.02.YYYY 12:02:43,DD.22.YYYY 19:22:32,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,TRUE,,,,,

This is General Electric’s largest grid-scale application of its sodium-nickel-chloride Durathon battery. As part of California’s permanent load shift program, the array is meant to shift 10% to 20% of the building’s electrical load from expensive peak times to cheaper, off-peak use, while also providing power when the grid goes down. It is one of the first deployments of battery technology aimed at such a large-scale shifting of power in a behind-the-meter setting.

The dam's spillway is controlled by seven radial gates, which, along with four regulating conduits at the bottom of the dam, give the dam a total maximum discharge of 112,000 cubic feet per second (3,200 m3/s). Hiwassee Lake stretches along the river for approximately 22 miles (35 km) to the town of Murphy, North Carolina, and has 180 miles (290 km) of shoreline, a storage capacity of 434,000 acre·ft (535,000 dam3) and 205,590 acre·ft (253,590 dam3) of flood storage. The reservoir's operating level varies by roughly 38 feet (12 m) in a typical year.

During the 1950s, TVA experimented with the idea of ""pumped storage"" at Hiwassee Dam. There it employed an energy-generating turbine that was run in reverse during low-demand hours to pump water below the dam into the upper reservoir. This integration of pump and turbine was the first of its kind in the United States; further, at the time it was the largest and most powerful in the world. The unit was built by Allis-Chalmers Company. The ""pump-turbine"" at Hiwassee is designated a ""National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark"" by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)

Alcatraz Island Microgrid ,Advanced Lead-acid Battery,Lead-acid Battery,Electro-chemical,400,4.75,Operational,Electric Supply Reserve Capacity - Non-Spinning,Onsite Renewable Generation Shifting,Renewables Capacity Firming,,,,,,,,,,38,"August 30, 1899",San Francisco,California,United States,Alcatraz Island,,"The US National Park Service, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, US Department of Energy and Princeton Power Systems collaborated to install a commercial scale Microgrid System on Alcatraz Island as a solution to high diesel fuel costs, pollution in the bay area, and high carbon emissions. When a ship’s anchor ruptured the underwater power lines in 1950, that linked the island to San Francisco, Alcatraz was forced to turn to diesel fuel and coal as its source of power. This has led to power costs of $0.76/kWh. 

Microgrid Design: 
This project reflects the National Park Service’s initiative to find an alternative way of powering the island in order to reduce fuel costs and pollution. A microgrid system, comprised of PPS inverters, a solar array, advanced lead-acid batteries, a PPS Site Controller, and back-up generators, was selected as a way to independently power the island. Designing and building the system on one of California’s and the U.S.’s most well-known historic landmarks with over 1 million visitors per year, created many challenges. 

Component Placement: Preserving the island in pristine condition while completing the installation was the greatest challenge. Given that a system of this size requires a large construction effort, component placement was key. To prevent the solar array from being visible from San Francisco, it was placed on the roof of the prison in a flat configuration rather than a traditional angled configuration. The inverters, battery rack, and generators were placed in the old generator room, as this space is isolated and not accessible for tourists. The room was also protected from the harsh salt water environment.

Commissioning: The fragile natural environment and wildlife, particularly the birds (Alcatraz is an old Spanish word for pelican), added to the challenge. Extra attention was given to the solar panels after being damaged by rocks and shells dropped from overhead birds. Despite the coarse condition of the generator room, engineers were able to insulate the room to prevent future problems and ensure reliable long-term operation.

Daytime energy demand from air conditioning – typically 40-50% of a building’s electricity use during peak daytime hours – can be reduced significantly. In kilowatts, each Ice Bear delivers an average reduction of 12 kW of source equivalent peak demand for a minimum of 6 hours daily, shifting 72 kW-hours of on-peak energy to off-peak hours.
Ice Bear units are typically owned by utilities and installed at distributed locations behind the customer meter on commercial and industrial sites.
When aggregated and deployed at scale, a typical utility deployment will shift the operation of thousands of commercial AC condensing units from on-peak periods to off-peak periods, reducing electric system demand, improving electric system load factor, reducing electric system costs, and improving overall electric system efficiency and power quality.",http://www.ice-energy.com,,,DD.09.YYYY,,CAISO,Azusa Light &amp; Water,Public Owned,,,Utility-Owned,Confidential,,,,Ice Energy,NA,Ice Energy,Ice Energy,Ice Energy,Ice Energy,,,,20,N/A,,,State/Provincial/Regional,,,,,,,,,,,,Andrew Nunn,anunn@ice-energy.com,(877)542-3232,,,,,,DD.57.YYYY 22:57:40,DD.28.YYYY 18:28:14,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The system stores energy at night, when electricity generation is cleaner, more efficient and less expensive, and delivers that energy during the peak of the day to provide cooling to the building.
Daytime energy demand from air conditioning – typically 40-50% of a building’s electricity use during peak daytime hours – can be reduced significantly. In kilowatts, each Ice Bear delivers an average reduction of 12 kW of source equivalent peak demand for a minimum of 6 hours daily, shifting 72 kW-hours of on-peak energy to off-peak hours.
Ice Bear units are typically owned by utilities and installed at distributed locations behind the customer meter on commercial and industrial sites.
When aggregated and deployed at scale, a typical utility deployment will shift the operation of thousands of commercial AC condensing units from on-peak periods to off-peak periods, reducing electric system demand, improving electric system load factor, reducing electric system costs, and improving overall electric system efficiency and power quality.",http://www.ice-energy.com,,,DD.08.YYYY,,ISO-NE,,Public Owned,,,Utility-Owned,Confidential,,,,Ice Energy,,Ice Energy,Ice Energy,Ice Energy,Ice Energy,,,,20,N/A,,,State/Provincial/Regional,,,,,,,,,,,,Andrew Nunn,anunn@ice-energy.com,(877)542-3232,,,,,,DD.57.YYYY 22:57:56,DD.00.YYYY 00:00:27,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the event of a power outage, the ESS provides enough energy to power the base, thus allowing it to function as an independent energy resource. 

In addition to seamless transition during grid failure, the ESS also provides valuable support services, including Power Factor Correction and Area Frequency Regulation services to the local electrical system operator while it is connected to the electric grid.

The microgrid provides enough clean energy to run the headquarters’ 12,000 square-foot Rodman Innovation Pavilion. It can operate as an independent power source or in support of the traditional electric grid, adding resilience while lowering energy costs. 

The system includes two natural gas-fired microturbines that deliver onsite electrical power and heat generation. During winter months, heat is recovered from the microturbines to support climate control for the World Headquarters, the largest office building in Kansas. A geothermal heat pump system with 15 wells each drilled 500 feet deep also helps heat and cool the Pavilion. The microgrid system also uses battery technology to capture and store energy from generation resources and deliver electricity to the headquarters during times of high electric demand.

The microgrid is capable of producing about 1,300 megawatt hours of power annually. It has three rooftop solar photovoltaic panel groups—monocrystalline, polycrystalline and AC modules that use micro inverters. They provide 50 kilowatts (kW) of electricity at their peak output. The two natural gas-fired microturbines deliver 130 kW of power generation. A 100 kWh lithium-ion battery energy storage system is used. The microgrid system can be islanded from the external electric grid and helps ensure electric supplies in the event of a power outage. The microgrid also provides power to a portion of the 45 electric vehicle charging stations at the World Headquarters.

It’s the largest lithium-ion battery installed in any aquarium or zoo in the U.S.
The goal is to cut the aquarium’s energy use in half by 2020. It's part of Shedd's Master Energy Roadmap plan, a green initiative started in 2012. In addition to the installation of the giant battery, the plan calls for replacing 75 percent of the aquarium’s lights with high efficiency LED lights and implementing enhanced automation systems that can adjust electricity use based on real-time shifts in electricity pricing.
The $2 million battery will generate revenue for the Shedd by maintaining the area's electrical grid at a frequency of 60 hertz for the regional transmission organization PJM, which manages the grid. For example, if it's a cloudy day and the city's solar panels aren't generating enough electricity, the battery will distribute extra power. It will also serve as emergency back-up power for the Shedd. 
The massive battery is visible to visitors from the loading dock outside or through the south Abbott Oceanarium window inside.
The battery, along with an adjoining transformer and inverter skid, were funded in part by a $500,000 grant from the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (IDCEO) and installed by Schneider Electric.

The PV system powers a battery storage solution consisting of a refrigerator-size LG Chem 30 kW / 45 kWh lithium-ion battery and an Ideal Power inverter, both controlled by a Geli Energy Operating System. With low electricity rates currently available through its local electric coop, RMI opted to remain connected to the grid. In the future, the Innovation Center’s power system will enable microgrid islanding, through which the building could supply its own power totally disconnected from grid.

The “brains” of the solar-plus-storage system, the Geli EOS, determines when to charge the battery (from the PV system or the grid) and when to discharge the battery to power the building. For example, if the Innovation Center draws an average of 50 kW or more from the grid in any 15-minute period during a month, the building is pushed into a rate tariff that imposes demand charges. The Geli EOS is programmed to automatically switch the system to battery power before hitting the 50 kW threshold.",http://www.triplepundit.com/2016/04/green-building-lessons-rocky-mountain-institute/#,,,DD.01.YYYY,,N/A,,Cooperative (Customer Owned),, 83 kW rooftop PV system ,Customer-Owned,Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI),,,,LG Chem,Ideal Power,Gexpro Automated by Geli,,Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI),,,,,20,http://buildingdashboard.com/clients/rmi/innovationcenter/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Andrew Krulewitz; Jesse Morris (RMI),ak@geli.net,,,,,,,DD.38.YYYY 22:38:34,DD.40.YYYY 22:40:06,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,TRUE,

The system will typically charge
the batteries during nighttime hours when energy is less costly and discharge during daytime peak demand periods. The PCS will
continually monitor the grid voltages for disruptions, sags and swells. If an out-of-tolerance voltage event occurs, the PCS will
quickly disconnect the critical plant load from the grid with a high-speed switch and feed the load with power from the batteries. When the grid voltages recovers to nominal values, the PCS will reconnect the load to the grid and proceed to recharge the
batteries. ",https://www.ngk.co.jp/nas/case_studies/,,,DD.12.YYYY,,PJM,,Investor Owned,,,Utility-Owned,American Electric Power (AEP),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Tom Weaver,TFWEAVER@aep.com,,,,,,,DD.46.YYYY 00:46:42,DD.36.YYYY 21:36:15,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Large pipes filled with glycol antifreeze connect the tanks to a chiller machine — basically a refrigerator — then smaller tubes, filled with the chilled antifreeze, circulate inside the tanks and those tubes are surrounded by water, and that water freezes solid.

In most parts of the country — energy is half price at night, so with this type of system you create your air conditioning at night, store it in the form of ice and then use it the next day to offset chiller operation using electricity.
